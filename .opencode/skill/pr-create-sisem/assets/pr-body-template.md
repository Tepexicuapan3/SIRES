## What and Why

- What changed:
  - [ ] {cambio 1}
  - [ ] {cambio 2}
- Why this change is needed:
  - {justificación de negocio/técnica}

## Domain Impact

- Primary domain: `{domain}`
- Domain status: `legacy` | `hybrid` | `domain-first`
- Additional domains impacted (if any):
  - {domain or `none`}

## Data Impact (required if DB/schema/query changes)

- Data owner domain: `{domain-owner}`
- PostgreSQL target impact (`expand` | `migrate` | `contract` | `N/A`):
  - {value + rationale}
- Cross-domain SQL access introduced?: `no` (required) / explain exception:
  - {evidence}
- Overload controls reviewed (partitioning, indexes, retention/archive, read-models, observability):
  - {evidence or `N/A` with reason}
- Criteria logical -> physical isolation evaluated?:
  - {yes/no + rationale}

## Jira and SDD Traceability

- Jira ticket: `{KAN-XXX}`
- Epic: `{KAN-YYY}` or `N/A`
- SDD change (if applies): `{change-id}` or `N/A`
- SDD phase status (`proposal/spec/design/tasks/apply/verify`):
  - {status}
- RFC cross-domain (required if multi-domain):
  - {link/path} or `N/A`
- Engram evidence (topic_key or note):
  - `{topic_key}`

## TDD-First Evidence (required for NEW feature / NEW functionality / LARGE refactor)

- Scope applies?: `yes` / `no` (if `no`, explain why):
  - {rationale}
- Tests-first planning/tasks link or excerpt (prove tests were planned before implementation):
  - {link/evidence}
- RED evidence (initial failing test):
  - {command + failing output reference}
- GREEN evidence (minimal implementation passing):
  - {command + passing output reference}
- REFACTOR evidence (cleanup with tests still passing):
  - {what changed + proof}
- Exception (if applicable): rationale + compensating controls/tests + approval (Jira/PR reviewer):
  - {details or `N/A`}

## KAN-55 Risk Gate (required for auth-access slices)

- Slice identifier (`S0..S6` if applies): `{slice}` or `N/A`
- Risk level (`P0` | `P1` | `P2`): `{risk}` or `N/A`
- Risk factor justification (auth/session, policy, audit, mutation, cross-domain):
  - {justification}
- Minimum evidence required for selected risk:
  - {evidence list}
- Go/No-Go result:
  - `{GO|NO-GO}`

## Evidence Matrix (mandatory)

| Ruta | Decisión aplicada | Impacto en este PR |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `docs/guides/pr-merge-governance.md` | {regla aplicada} | {impacto} |
